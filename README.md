Robot Application for mirage, our 2026 Robot for FIRST REBUILD

## Building

To build the application locally, run

```bash
./gradlew build
```

Keep in mind you will have to periodically connect to internet so gradle can sync dependencies.

To deploy the application, connect to the robot and run

```bash
./gradlew deploy
```
